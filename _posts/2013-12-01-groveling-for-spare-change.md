Here and there around the Internet you'll find sites that give Bitcoin away. This isn't insane; this is actually pretty smart.

They're not giving away a ton of money; each one typically dispenses &#0579;0.00000020, or two one-millionths of a Bitcoin. <a href="http://freebitcoinlottery.com">Free Bitcoin Lottery</a> pays even less: two ten-millionths of a Bitcoin, otherwise known as a "satoshi," after Bitcoin's mythical founder. (Although: I have once hit the four-number combo at FBL, which paid 20 &micro;&#0579;.)

If you were to set a half-hour timer and grind your way through every free site <a href="http://coinbox.me">coinbox.me</a> operates, sixteen times in eight hours, you'd wind up with the princely sum of  &#0579;0.0000688, which (as of now) is worth about nine cents.

Over on <a href="http://bitcoinget.com">BitcoinGet</a> you'll find tasks you can do through Crowdflower. You'll need to register with an e-mail address on Crowdflower; don't use one you care about. Once you're logged in you'll occasionally see tasks go by for 8 or 9 &micro;&#0579;.  These are pretty sweet when they show up, but are still something you should think of as a relatively high score on a video game that cost you a quarter to play.

Lots of tiny payouts going into the same address will result in higher transaction fees when you go to spend them.  It's not like a checking account, where 10,000 pennies becomes $100. When you go to spend your ill-gotten satoshii, the network will view you with the same level of suspicion and annoyance that a convenience store operator aims at the guy with the sackful of pennies, nickels, and dimes who's trying to buy a twelve-pack of Coors.
