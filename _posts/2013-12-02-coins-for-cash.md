If you're like me, you're pretty paranoid about plugging your credit card number or bank account into an online exchange for imaginary currency.  You'd at least like to cut your possible losses to cash on hand, right?

Looks like a respectable operation in progress at <a href="https://cashintocoins.com/">CashIntoCoins</a>. These guys want you to go to any bank, deposit cash, and take a picture of the receipt.  Once they have it, your Bitcoins are on the way.

To see transfers in progress, check out <a href="https://cashintocoins.com/pages/status.php">their status page</a>.

The whole idea reminds me of those coins-into-goodies machines you see in grocery stores; seems like you could take people's accumulated spare change off their hands for Bitcoin.

Oh, hey: here's <a href="http://www.psfk.com/2013/08/bitcoin-conversion-suitcase.html">a coin counter mounted in a briefcase</a> that does this exact thing. $250 worth of parts, including a Raspberry Pi and a 4G modem. These guys were taking 15% of each transaction; pretty sweet!

Another fine way to go about this is to look for a face-to-face deal. <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">LocalBitcoins.com</a> contains a large list of traders, with eBay-style feedback. <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/ad/19659/">My local guy</a> will come out and meet you at Philz on Forrest in Palo Alto.
