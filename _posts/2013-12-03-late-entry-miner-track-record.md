{% include JB/setup %}

Entrepreneur-hero <a href="https://twitter.com/sampullara">Sam Pullara</a> is running one of those small Bitcoin mining rigs out of his home. Here's a <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=30days&showDataPoints=true&daysAverageString=7&show_header=true&scale=0&address=1NHKyhD2TQcoo8fkpf87Dj3E2EDGpPgSu2">graph from Blockchain</a> showing how it's doing.

As of a couple of days ago, Sam says the cost of the electricity he's putting in is double the value of the Bitcoin he's getting out.

How much longer before somebody (probably in a Foxconn plant in China) hooks a stationary bicycle to a generator and creates an actual human-powered Bitcoin miner?
