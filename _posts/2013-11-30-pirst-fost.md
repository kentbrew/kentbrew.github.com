Couple weeks back I say "okay, time to get some Bitcoin." I figure it might be around a hundred bucks; I will swallow hard and buy one, in the safest way I can figure out.

Nope. It's $400+, and there's no safe way to do this I can see. I piddle around a bit and get an address, try groveling for Bitcoin at a couple of the free sites, and get bored.

Two weeks later it's $1100+ and I am thinking "holy cow, this thing is either real or in a huge bubble."
