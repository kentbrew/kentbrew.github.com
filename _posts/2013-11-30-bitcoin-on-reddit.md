I was delighted to discover Reddit's integrated Bitcoin tipping system. As long as you have a bit of "karma" to spare on Reddit, you can redeem it for a tiny amount of Bitcoin, get an address, accept tips, and withdraw to an outside address.

You may also buy and sell with tips on Reddit's BitMarket, which wasn't nearly as scary as blindly poking numbers into a wallet address somewhere.

When I tried to sell something (a Starbucks card) on Bitmarket, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BitMarket/comments/1rfkz3/wts_10_starbucks_gift_card_for_666_btc/">it worked the first time I tried it</a>.

I've made a tip-me-on-Bitcoin badge; here it is:

If you'd like to try it out, it's on GitHub, here:

If it works for you, you know what to do! :)
